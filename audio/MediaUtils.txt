How to use the MediaUtils.java?
1. Add your sound files in the assets directory
2. add "private MediaPlayer m;" in any activity or fragment

then when you want to play the specific sound file do this:

playSound(m, "sound.mp3");

to stop playing the sound file(if looping was enabled)

then use this...
stopSound(m);
